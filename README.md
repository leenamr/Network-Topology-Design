# Final Project Report: Network Topology Design and Implementation

## Abstract
This project involves the design, configuration, and implementation of a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. The topology consists of three ISR4331 routers, three 2960 switches, 11 PCs, and a server. The network is logically segmented using VLANs to ensure efficient traffic management and security. Routing protocols such as OSPF were configured for dynamic inter-VLAN routing, while NAT and ACLs were implemented to provide secure external access.

## Objectives
- Design a network topology with three routers, three switches, 11 PCs, and a server.
- Configure VLANs for logical segmentation of the network.
- Implement inter-VLAN routing using OSPF for dynamic connectivity.
- Configure DHCP to automate IP address assignment for specific VLANs.
- Set up NAT and PAT to enable secure communication between private and public networks.
- Apply ACLs to restrict unauthorized access and manage traffic effectively.
- Validate connectivity and ensure compliance with project requirements.

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLANs
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- NAT (Network Address Translation)
- ACLs (Access Control Lists)

## How to Use
- Download the Cisco Packet Tracer file.
- Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer to view the network topology.
- Refer to the `Final Project Report.pdf` for detailed explanations and configurations.
